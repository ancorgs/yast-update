See bug #44286 why we need this workflow to update pre 9.2 systems.


The user has chosen the root partition /, the partition is mounted and we have
read fstab.


0. Transform fstab based on fixed renaming schemes.


1. Does fstab have a /var partition?

   - No: Step 9.

   - Yes: Step 2.


2. Is device of /var on a real disk?

   - No: Step 8.

   - Yes: Step 3.


3. Are / and /var on the same disk (only with a differnet number)?

   - Yes: Transform device of /var just like / and Step 8.

   - No: Step 4.


4. How many real disks do we have?

   - 2: Step 5.

   - More than 2: Give it up.


5. Mount partition with number of /var on other real disk.  Is it a /var
   partition?

   - Yes: Step 9.

   - No: Give it up.


8. Mount /var.


9. Transform fstab and cryptotab using "hwinfo --map".  Mount the remaining
   partitions from fstab.

   Do a sanity check, e.g. device mounted as / is same as in transformed
   fstab.
